arduino-PlantWaterer
====================

Uses a soil moisture sensor, and servo to water plants when the soil is dry.

This is my first real Arduino project. It checks the soil mositure on a set interval.
If the soil is wet, it begins a watering processes which waters for a set interval,
then lets it soak in, and then begins the soil moisture process again.
